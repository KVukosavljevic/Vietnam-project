There are 40 patients in the data set.
The first 30 are NORMAL and the last 10 are ABNORMAL.

Data set:

Generate a training and testing data set as following:
    - first visits in the training set, second visits in the test set.
    - this set makes the assumption that the visits are mutually independent even if the recordings belong to the same patient

Alternative option:
    - 20 + 6 in training x 2 visits and (10 + 4) x 2 in the test sets
    - Also independence assumption since we are using data from the same patients in the sets, but no patient overlap between the sets
